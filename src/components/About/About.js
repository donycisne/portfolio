            <p>
              I'm a full stack developer from Per√∫ living in Buenos Aires,
              Argentina. I'm always looking for an opportunity to code and learn
              new things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a native spanish speaker with an proficient english level.
            </p>
            <p>
              I study everyday to learn something new with programming. I like
              to code everything I imagine and I think it can make a social
              impact sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like watch movies about history and economics also I enjoy
              attending the events of the developer community and meeting people
              with different perspectives on things, diversity for me is the key
              to making things better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Music is an important part of my life, I play the sax and the
              traverse flute, I did some funny things when I was younger like
              trying to be an actor.
